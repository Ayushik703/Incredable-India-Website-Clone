        <p>The legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, is perfectly preserved in India. From various museums
            and memorials to Gandhiji's ashram, there are various stopovers in the country that testify of the great
            life of the leader. His philosophies of truth and non-violence inspire millions and many people trace his
            footsteps by visiting the various monuments dedicated to him. Gandhiji's contribution to human development
            is far too great and varied to have been forgotten or overlooked. The world today recognises him as a far
            more compelling social innovator than humanity ever realised.</p> <br>
        <button id="more" class="read">Read More</button><br>
        <div class="hiddenPara">
            <h3>India - The land of Gandhi</h3>
            <p>From 1915 to 1948, Mahatma Gandhi travelled extensively around India, sparking the fires of revolution
                and
                unifying the country for one of the greatest freedom struggles of all times. Today, he stands as a tall
                figure in the freedom history of the nation, he helped build. As one journey through the country, the
                lasting impressions of Gandhiji's philosophies and principles seem to be embedded in the very fabric of
                Indian society - from the beliefs of equality and non-violence to those of inclusion and brotherhood. As
                we
                trace the footsteps of the 'Father of the Nation', it becomes evident how the leader's heritage lives
                on.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>Return to India</h3>
            <p>On January 9, 1915, a crowd gathered to greet Gandhiji and his wife, Kasturba, as their ship, the S.S.
                Arabia
                docked in Apollo Bunder, in Bombay (now Mumbai). “I was filled with joy when, nearing Bombay I sighted
                the
                coast,” Gandhi wrote in a letter to his relative, Maganlal. It had been almost 22 years when the eager
                young
                lawyer had left his home to seek a break in his career, and who returned now was a seasoned Satyagrahi
                who
                was revered as one of the greatest leaders of his time.</p><br>
            <h3>Porbandar</h3>
            <p>After a brief spell in Bombay, Gandhiji visited his birthplace, Porbandar. As he and his wife deboarded
                the
                train, a huge crowd jostled its way towards them. Everyone wanted to know what the man, whose fame had
                preceded him to the city, looked like. The press of people was such that Gandhiji and Kasturba barely
                made
                it to their motor car, which was to take them to his ancestral home, Kirti Mandir . A 200-year-old
                building,
                Kirti Mandir complex is the place where he was born in 1869.</p>
            <p>Today, it is an altar of sorts for those who follow in Bapu's footsteps and his ideologies. The sprawling
                square-shaped haveli, with a vast courtyard, an open terrace and iron grid windows, is adorned with
                memoirs
                and pictures of young Gandhi. One such portrait is captioned ‘Gandhiji at seven’ and shows a boisterous
                jacket-clad boy with a round topi (that later was called the signature Gandhi topi) on his head, a tikka
                on
                his forehead and a chain around his neck. There are several pictures of Kasturba Gandhi as well and many
                of
                the two sharing lighter moments.</p>
            <p>To mark the release of Gandhiji's release from prison in 1944, the residents of Porbandar built a temple
                adjacent to the haveli. This temple has now been converted into a small museum that displays items used
                by
                Gandhiji, along with some really old photographs. The museum also houses a library that has books either
                written by him or relating to his philosophies. The temple has been visited by several world leaders who
                came here to pay their respects to Gandhiji.</p><br>
            <h3>Rajkot</h3>
            <p>Before starting his Satyagraha movement, Gandhiji sought to travel the country via railways to understand
                the
                integral threads of the great and diverse social fabric of India. As promised to his friend Gopal
                Krishna
                Gokhale, a leader of the Indian National Congress, he put himself on a 'probation period' and flagged
                off
                his travels from Rajkot , where he had spent his childhood as the son of the Diwan (1881 to 1887 AD).
                His
                residence Kaba Gandhi No Delo is an unmissable heritage site today. One can witness the life of the
                Mahatma
                in pictures in the house that have both Hindi and Gujarati captions. The structure of the building has
                been
                built in a Saurashtrian style of architecture and boasts arched gateways and courtyards. Many relics
                like
                Gandhi's personal belongings and other objects are also housed here. Gandhi's passion for handloom is
                encouraged in a weaving school here that offers classes in sewing and embroidery to young girls.
                Visitors
                can also visit Mahatma Gandhi Museum that has been housed inside the school where Gandhiji studied as a
                boy.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Benaras (Varanasi)</h3>
            <p>After Gandhiji's 'probation' ended in 1916, he was invited to Varanasi for the laying of the foundation
                stone
                of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). It is said that the eloquent speech he delivered there, marked
                the
                start of his political movement in India.</p>
            <p>"It is a matter of deep humiliation and shame for us,’ he said, ‘that I am compelled this evening under
                the
                shadow of this great college, in the sacred city, to address my countrymen in a language that is foreign
                to
                me."
                When the silent city heard these unflinching words, it seemed to hail the start of a revolution, and the
                arrival of a leader.
                Today, walking through the campus of the great varsity, one can almost feel the aura of Gandhi
                lingering.
                Later, in 1936, Gandhiji inaugurated a significant landmark in the city - Bharat Mata Mandir . This
                unique
                temple worships no gods or goddesses except Bharat Mata (Mother India). It houses a marble statue of
                Bharat
                Mata (Mother India), which is modelled to symbolise India. Its design indicates the goddess of India for
                all
                the religious deities, leaders and freedom fighters. It also houses a marble relief geographical map of
                undivided India, representing plains, mountains and oceans.</p><br>
            <h3>Ahmedabad</h3>
            <p>Ahmedabad

                After a brief stay in Santiniketan (West Bengal), where he met Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore,
                Gandhiji
                headed to Ahmedabad in 1915. There he founded a small communal settlement on the banks of the Sabarmati
                river called Sabarmati Ashram , which would be the centre of his non-violent struggle against the
                British.
            </p>
            <p>His aura still lingers here and one can travel back in time to get a sense of his ideology and remarkable
                life. Documents related to his non-violence movement, including the Dandi March, which began from here,
                have
                been put on display at the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya (museum). There is a library for literature on
                Gandhi
                that holds an immense archive of letters written by him, most of them on used paper scraps. The ashram
                shares its land with Hridaykunj — the quarters where he lived; Vinoba-Mira Kutir, a guest house, a
                prayer
                land and a building used as a training centre for cottage industries.
                By the time the ashram was established Gandhiji had started wearing his signature dhoti and sandals (an
                outfit he had adopted to mingle well with the poor without his fame getting in the way). Soon, he learnt
                the
                art of spinning and weaving and led the production of khadi, which became a pioneer movement. Another
                must-visit site is Kalam Kush, a paper factory that turns scraps of waste cotton into paper. It was
                among
                the many cottage industries introduced by Gandhiji. Today, the factory makes for a fascinating visit as
                you
                can see how paper is created without the use of chemicals.</p><br>
            <h3>Bombay (Mumbai)</h3>
            <p>From the moment Gandhi arrived in India, through the launch of about six national movements, Bombay
                remained
                the epicentre of most of his activities between 1917 and 1934. His base in the city was Mani Bhavan , a
                modest two-storey building. In 1955, this historic heritage was converted into a memorial for Mahatma
                Gandhi
                and chronicles the story of India’s independence. Notably, it witnessed a four-day fast conducted by
                Mahatma
                Gandhi back in 1921, to restore peace in Mumbai . It was in Mani Bhavan that Gandhiji started his
                association with the charkha or the spinning wheel. Interestingly, the initiations of noted agitations
                like
                the Civil Disobedience, Satyagraha, Swadeshi, Khadi and Khilafat movements were started here. A walk
                through
                its exalted corridors takes us back to the political struggles held during the Indian freedom struggle.
                The
                photo section in the museum has a lot of information and can be an invaluable guide for those interested
                in
                revisiting the history of India. </p><br>
            <h3>Pune</h3>
            <p>In 1942, after the launch of the Quit India Movement, Gandhiji and Kasturba were interned at the Aga Khan
                Palace in Pune , along with their secretary Mahadev Desai. This palatial mansion, built in 1892 by
                Sultan
                Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III, became the place where both Ba (as Kasturba Gandhi was fondly known) and
                Desai
                died of a heart attack. Their memorials, made of marble, still stand here. </p>
            <p>Today, this grand building boasts Italian architecture and sculpted lawns, and is now the headquarters of
                the
                Gandhi National Memorial Society. Khadi, the handwoven natural fibre that Gandhiji used to spin on his
                charkha, is still made here. The 2.5-m-long circular corridor is well-known, running the periphery of
                the
                palace. There are several photographs and portraits of Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders of the freedom
                movement; one of the most impressive and moving of these is a tableau of the Mahatma leading a protest
                march
                against the British. Visitors can also take a gander at Gandhiji’s work at the Sewagram, located 8 km in
                the
                village of Wardha. Other highlights of the palace that are open to public viewing are the room in which
                he
                stayed with Kasturba Gandhi, as well as his charkha, sandals and other personal belongings. </p><br>
            <h3>Delhi</h3>
            <p>It was a chilly day in January, and 78-year-old Mahatma Gandhi was walking from Birla House to the lawn
                where
                his prayers were held. As he leaned on his two grand nieces for support, he was greeted by a young man
                dressed in blue trousers and khaki bush jacket. After a brief 'Namaste', the man, who would later be
                recognised as Nathuram Godse, whipped out his pistol and shot Gandhiji three times at the point-blank
                range.
            </p>
            <p>The nation mourned the loss of their great leader, and a great samadhi was dedicated to him at Raj Ghat
                in
                the national capital. The Father of the Nation was cremated here on January 31, 1948, and today millions
                visit this site to pay homage to him. Lying on the banks of the Yamuna river, Raj Ghat is fringed by
                lush
                well-manicured lawns that are dotted with trees. The samadhi is a true reflection of the man himself and
                exudes a simplicity that he came to be associated with. A brick platform where his body was burned and a
                black marble platform are surrounded by a marble fence. The words ‘He Ram’, which was the last thing
                Gandhiji said, have been inscribed on the memorial. An eternal flame stands adjacent to it. Various
                trees
                that dot the landscape have been planted by dignitaries like Queen Elizabeth II, former US president
                Dwight
                Eisenhower, former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitman etc., and bear their names on a plaque.
                Visitors
                are required to remove their shoes before paying homage to the leader. A ceremony is held every Friday
                to
                mark the day he died. There are two museums nearby, which are dedicated to Gandhiji.</p>
